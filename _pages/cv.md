Experience
======
* **[Aveni](https://aveni.ai/) — Senior NLP Engineer** — Edinburgh, Aug 2024-present<br/>
  NLP in the finance domain.

* **[Efficient Translation Limited](https://private.mt/) — Deep Learning Engineer** (part-time) — Edinburgh, Dec 2023-Apr 2024<br/>
  Corpus extraction and efficient low-resource machine translation.
  * Trained efficient machine translation and corpus cleaning models for low-resource language pairs.
  * Ran and optimised an efficient scalable parallel corpus extraction pipeline on web-scale data.
  * Delivered datasets and models to customers on time and meeting requirements

* **[University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) — Visiting Researcher** — Zurich, Mar 2023-May 2023<br/>
  Three-month visit, conducting research on detection and analysis of underspecification of the source sentence in machine translation, supervised by Dr. [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/sennrich.html) at the [Department of Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies.html).

* **[Amazon AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/) — Applied Scientist Intern** — Santa Clara, Nov 2022-Feb 2023<br/>
  Worked on isochronous machine translation for automatic dubbing. Co-organised the [dubbing track](https://iwslt.org/2023/dubbing) at IWSLT 2023.

* **[TAUS](https://www.taus.net/) — Data Engineer** — Amsterdam, Jun-Oct 2020<br/>
  Worked on the EU-funded [ParaCrawl](https://www.paracrawl.eu/) project to collect parallel corpora from large-scale web crawls.
  * Optimised, maintained, and ran a highly scalable processing pipeline to extract, translate, align,
and clean parallel corpora from web crawling data.
  * Consolidated and released the ParaCrawl corpus v7.0 and v7.1, comprising hundreds of millions
of sentence pairs in many languages.

* **[Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/) — Junior AI Researcher** — Lisbon, Feb-Apr 2020<br/>
  Machine translation and quality estimation for customer-facing products.
  * Built domain-specific machine translation models.
  * Built quality estimation models to skip human post-editing for high-quality MT output.

* **[World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)](https://www.wipo.int) — Fellow in Machine Translation** — Geneva, Feb 2018-Jan 2020<br/>
  Development and maintenance of [WIPO Translate](https://www.wipo.int/wipo-translate/en/) and related NLP tools and technologies.
  * [*WIPO Translate*](https://www.wipo.int/ai-tools-services/en/wipo-translate.html): Built, improved, evaluated and deployed domain-specific neural and statistical machine translation models using the Marian and Moses toolkits.
  * [*IPCCAT*](https://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/): Developed neural text classification systems for patent categorisation.
  * Developed a system to retrieve semantically similar content from large collections of text using sentence embeddings and Faiss indexes.
  * Instrumental in the training and deployment of neural MT systems at several other international organisations and patent offices including IMF, OECD, WTO, IAEA, and KIPO.

* **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) — Research Assistant** — Edinburgh, Sep-Dec 2017<br/>
  Low-resource domain-specific machine translation research on the MeMaT project. Supervised by Kenneth Heafield and Alexandra Birch.
  * Worked on an EPSRC GCRF-funded [project](https://old.cs.uct.ac.za/workshop-on-english-isixhosa-machine-translation-for-healthcare) in collaboration with the University of Cape Town to build a machine translation system to facilitate communication in the medical domain between isiXhosa-speaking patients and English-speaking doctors in health centres in South Africa.
  * Collected corpora released as a [public resource](https://opus.nlpl.eu/memat/corpus/version/memat).
