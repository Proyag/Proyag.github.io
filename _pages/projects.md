### Contributions to large-scale funded academic projects
* [ParaCrawl](https://www.paracrawl.eu/)
  * EU(CEF)-funded project to collect parallel corpora from large-scale web crawls.
  * Optimised, maintained, and ran a highly scalable processing pipeline to extract, translate, align, and clean parallel corpora obtained through web crawling.

* Medical Machine Translation
  * EPSRC GCRF-funded project in collaboration with the University of Cape Town to build a machine translation system to facilitate communication in the medical domain between isiXhosa-speaking patients and English-speaking doctors in health centres in South Africa.
  * Built parallel corpora through web crawls and a limited amount of human translation and used various low-resource machine translation strategies in attempts to build a usable translation system.

### Projects done solo or as a leading member of a team
* Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood to Improve Neural Machine Translation Training
  * MSc project at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Dr. [Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/).
  * Implemented the [Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood method](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/hash/2f885d0fbe2e131bfc9d98363e55d1d4-Abstract.html) and improved the quality of translation of the University of Edinburgh's neural machine translation system by augmenting the training objective with reinforcement learning-inspired task rewards.
  * Obtained an improvement of 1.07 BLEU points over the baseline cross-entropy trained system.
  * [Open-source implementation](https://github.com/Proyag/nematus) based on the Python Theano-based Nematus framework.
* Flow Shop Scheduling Optimisation using Natural Algorithms
  * Optimisation of flow shop scheduling on the basis of makespan computation using natural (genetic) algorithms.
  * [Open-source implementation](https://github.com/Proyag/FlowShopProject) based on Python (NumPy).
  * With [Kaustav Basu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~kbasu2/) and Triparna Mukherjee.
* Traffic Rule Violation Information System (TRuVIS)
  * A device which could be placed in motor vehicles to automatically detect violation of traffic rules and report to traffic police, specifically designed for no-horn zone violations.
  * With [Kaustav Basu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~kbasu2/), Dibyabiva Seth, and Triparna Mukherjee.
* Android Notifier Accessory
  * An affordable wearable Android accessory to display phone notifications on a wristwatch-like device.
  * With [Kaustav Basu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~kbasu2/) and Dibyabiva Seth.
