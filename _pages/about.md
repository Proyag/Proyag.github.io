I'm a Senior AI Engineer at [Aveni](https://aveni.ai/), building [FinLLM](https://labs.aveni.ai/finllm/) - LLMs for the financial services domain. I work across the model creation pipeline - on data filtering, pre-training, fine-tuning, pruning and distillation, domain adaptation, evaluation, and retrieval-augmented generation. I'm also working with the Agentic AI team to develop [Agent Assure](https://aveni.ai/agent-assure/) for automated safety and compliance assurance of AI agents in the financial services domain.

I recently finished my PhD on **machine translation** at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), which is part of the School of Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I was working under the supervision of Dr. [Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/) and Dr. [Alexandra Birch](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandra-birch) as a member of the [StatMT](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/People) group.

The focus of my PhD thesis was enriching machine translation (MT) models with extra information that they need in addition to source language sentences in order to generate accurate translations. I'm particularly interested in analysis of neural MT models, multilingual and document-level machine translation, and multi-encoder neural architectures. For example, I have used multi-encoder models to provide additional context to neural MT models to analyse and improve them, created large-scale datasets for document-level MT, and worked on better ways to incorporate timing information in isochronous MT models for automatic dubbing. To see some examples of things I've worked on, have a look at my [CV](/cv), [Publications](/publications), and [Projects](/projects) pages.

During the course of my PhD, I also went on a research visit to the University of Zurich's [Department of Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/research-groups/texttechnologies.html), where I was working with Dr. [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/about-us/people/team/compling/sennrich.html), and did an internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/), where I worked on automatic dubbing.

Previously I've worked at TAUS, Unbabel, WIPO, and the University of Edinburgh — with all these roles focusing on Machine Translation and more generally, Natural Language Processing.
