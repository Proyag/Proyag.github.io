I'm a PhD student working on **machine translation** at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), which is part of the School of Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I'm working under the supervision of Dr. [Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/) as a member of the [StatMT](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/People) group.

I also recently finished a research visit at the University of Zurich's [Department of Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies.html), where I was working with Dr. [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/sennrich.html), and an internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/).

My current focus is on using multi-encoder models to provide additional context to neural machine translation models to analyse and improve them. In general, I'm interested in analysis of neural machine translation models, low-resource and multilingual machine translation, and multi-encoder neural architectures. To see some examples of things I've worked on, have a look at my [CV](/cv), [Publications](/publications), and [Projects](/projects) pages.

Previously I've worked at TAUS, Unbabel, WIPO, and the University of Edinburgh â€” with all these roles focusing on Machine Translation and more generally, Natural Language Processing.
