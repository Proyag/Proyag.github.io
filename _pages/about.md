I'm a PhD student working on machine translation at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), which is part of the School of Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I'm working under the supervision of Dr. [Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/) as a member of the [StatMT](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/People) group.

My current interests lie in improving low-resource machine translation through the use of multilingual models. To see some examples of things I've worked on, have a look at my [CV](/cv) and/or [Projects](/projects) pages.

Previously I've worked at TAUS, Unbabel, WIPO, and the University of Edinburgh â€” with all these roles focusing on Machine Translation and more generally, Natural Language Processing.
