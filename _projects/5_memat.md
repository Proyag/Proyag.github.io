EPSRC GCRF-funded project in collaboration with the University of Cape Town to build a machine translation system to facilitate communication in the medical domain between isiXhosa-speaking patients and English-speaking doctors in health centres in South Africa. I participated as a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh.

Built parallel corpora through web crawls and a limited amount of human translation and used various low-resource machine translation strategies in attempts to build a usable translation system.

The collected parallel corpora were made [publicly available](http://statmt.org/memat/).

A workshop was hosted by the University of Cape Town, where I [presented](/talks/memat) some preliminary results and the challenges faced while building such systems.
