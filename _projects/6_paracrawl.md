Long-term EU(CEF)-funded project to collect parallel corpora from large-scale web crawls. I participated during my time as a data engineer at one of the project partners â€” TAUS.

Worked mainly with partners at the University of Edinburgh to optimise, maintain, and run a highly scalable processing pipeline to extract, translate, align, and clean parallel corpora obtained through web crawling.

Released corpora and further information on [project website](https://www.paracrawl.eu/). Released software on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitextor).
