MSc project at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Dr. [Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/). Implemented the [Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood method](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/hash/2f885d0fbe2e131bfc9d98363e55d1d4-Abstract.html) and improved the quality of translation of the University of Edinburgh's neural machine translation system by augmenting the training objective with reinforcement learning-inspired task rewards.

Obtained an improvement of 1.07 BLEU points over the baseline cross-entropy trained system.

[Open-source implementation](https://github.com/Proyag/nematus) based on the Python Theano-based Nematus framework.
