As part of a project to develop medical domain machine translation systems between isiXhosa and English (see [project page](/projects/memat) for more details), the University of Cape Town hosted a [workshop](https://www.cs.uct.ac.za/workshop-on-english-isixhosa-machine-translation-for-healthcare/), where I presented the challenges of building such a system in low-resource languages, some low-resource techniques to build better MT systems, the data used for building the medical domain isiXhosa-English MT models, and some preliminary results.

For some great examples of bad translations, see the [slides](/files/slides/UctMematDec17.pdf).
